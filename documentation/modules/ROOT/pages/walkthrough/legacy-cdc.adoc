[#cdc]
== Legacy App Change Data Capture

In this section we're going to put all the pieces together and demonstrate the ability to have our website updated based on debezium and a consumer that we write.  This is the general plan:

. Remember that we've already uploaded a number of items and quantities into the inventory via the legacy app
+
image:loaded-inventory.png[]
+
. Go to the `{kafka-project}` project, Developer Perspective
. First we will deploy the Strimzi-ified KafkaConnect and Debezium Connector for our application.  Show them briefly this playbook:
+
.provision_debezium.yaml
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$provision_debezium.yaml[]
----
+
. To deploy the playbook, run the following in the shell
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ansible-playbook -i pass:[${DEMO_HOME}]/ansible/demo/inventory \
    pass:[${DEMO_HOME}]/ansible/demo/main.yaml \
    -e "ACTION=debezium_create" 
----
+
. From the Developer Perspective, the elements appear and try to match them to the playbook logs.
. Wait for the dbz-ui to appear indicating the end of the playbook
. Search for the KafkaConnect for `debezium` as shown:
+
image::search-dbz-connect.png[]
+
. Review the yaml (see below for example from playbook)
NOTE: You may need to wait a while until the connector is in a `ready` state before you see the status appear.  You can wait either on the Topology page or on the CR page
** Point out all the possible connectors that can be registered within this connect (for all the different databases)
+
image:status-connectors.png[]
+
. Back in the Topology View, click on the link badge of the `dbz-ui` and show the visualization of the debezium connector:
+
image::dbz-ui-badge.png[]
image::dbz-ui.png[]
+
. Search for the `KafkaConnector` and click on the `debezium-connector` 
+
image:search-dbz-connector.png[]
+
. Review the YAML (see below for example from playbook)
** Point out the legacy topic we want to watch
+
.kafka-connector-mssql.yaml.j2
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$kafka-connector-mssql.yaml.j2[]
----
+
[#watchcdctopic]
. Now let's watch that legacy topic that we see in the connector.  We'd expect there should be data there for the one row we added to the legacy database
+
[tabs,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
====	
Terminal 4::
+
--
include::ROOT:partial$watch-cdc-topic-console.adoc[]

+
. After a few moments, a blob of JSON should appear that looks something like the following (just unformatted):
+
.testCreateEvent-1.15.json
[source,json,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$testCreateEvent-1.15.json[]
----
+
. Copy the JSON blob and paste it into an online JSON formatting service such as link:https://jsonformatter.org/[JSON Formatter]
+
image:json-formatter.png[]
+
. Use folding ability to point out the following parts of the message:
** `schema`
** `payload` 
** `before` and `after`
** `op`
+
