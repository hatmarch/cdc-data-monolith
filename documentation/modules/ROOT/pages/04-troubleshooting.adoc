== Troubleshooting Kafka

=== Cluster fails to startup after OCP cluster restart

Sometimes with publically exposed kafka cluster (using OCP routes) the cluster gets stuck due to some race condition with the Route resource being reported.  The operator then gets into a state that prevents it from healing the Kafka cluster.

From the `Topology View` of your cluster, it might look like this:

To remedy, you can try running this command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get pods -n openshift-operators -oname | grep amq-streams-cluster-operator | xargs oc delete -n openshift-operators

[#kafkaconnect]
== Troubleshooting Kafka Connect

=== Change events not coming from the connector

. Check to see if there are any events on the topic as outlined xref:03-appendix.adoc#kafkatopicdebug[here]
. If no events are found, check the connector status
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc exec -it deploy/{kafka-connect-name} -n pass:[${KAFKA_PROJECT}] -- curl http://localhost:8083/connectors/{kafka-connector-name}/status
----
+
. You should see output like this:
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{"name":"{kafka-connector-name}","connector":{"state":"RUNNING","worker_id":"10.131.0.215:8083"},"tasks":[{"id":0,"state":"RUNNING","worker_id":"10.131.0.215:8083"}],"type":"source"}
----
+
. Attempt to restart the connector task
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc exec -it deploy/{kafka-connect-name} -n pass:[${KAFKA_PROJECT}] -- curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/connectors/{kafka-connector-name}/tasks/0/restart

=== Debezium fails to connect to database

**Symptom:** You will see the following in the Kakfa connect logs

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
2021-03-04 04:05:55,115 WARN No whitelisted table has enabled CDC, whitelisted table list does not contain any table with CDC enabled or no table match the white/blacklist filter(s) (io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.SqlServerStreamingChangeEventSource) [debezium-sqlserverconnector-mssql-server-linux-change-event-source-coordinator]
----

This has been fixed by:

. Deleting and recreating the database
. Deleting the connect pod
** NOTE: Whilst the database is deleted and recreated, the connection appears to die and it doesn't restart itselfðŸ˜ž
